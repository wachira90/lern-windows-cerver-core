Certainly. To get and set the interface name in Windows Server Core, you can use PowerShell commands. Here's how to do it:

1. To get the interface name:

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter
```

This command will list all network adapters with their names and other details.

2. To set (rename) the interface:

```powershell
Rename-NetAdapter -Name "OldName" -NewName "NewName"
```

Replace "OldName" with the current name of the interface and "NewName" with the desired new name.

If you want to use these commands in conjunction with the IP setting commands, you can do the following:

1. First, get the current interface name:

```powershell
$interfaceName = (Get-NetAdapter | Select-Object -First 1).Name
```

This command gets the name of the first network adapter and stores it in the $interfaceName variable.

2. Then use this variable in your IP and DNS setting commands:

```powershell
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias $interfaceName -IPAddress 192.168.10.11 -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway 192.168.10.1

Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias $interfaceName -ServerAddresses ("8.8.8.8","8.8.4.4")
```

This approach allows you to use the correct interface name without having to manually specify it.

Would you like me to explain or break down any part of these commands?

To set the IP address, gateway, and DNS servers for a Windows Server Core installation, you can use the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
# Set IP address and subnet mask
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -IPAddress 192.168.10.11 -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway 192.168.10.1

# Set DNS servers
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddresses ("8.8.8.8","8.8.4.4")
```
